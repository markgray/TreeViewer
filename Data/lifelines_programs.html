    This is an overview of the report programs distributed with Lifelines.
    If you want more information about a program, often there are comments
    at the beginning of the program that talk about functionality and algorithms,
    that have sample output and examples of post processing commands required to
    properly view the results.
    Some programs require customization before use, for example, they might
    have text identifying the person who generated the report.
<dl>
    <dt><b>2ppage</b>
    <dd>Version 1.0; by Wetmore, Manis; output format Text, 80 cols.

        <br>
        This script prompts for a message and adds the message along with todays date
        as a Source record on each individual and Family in the database. It checks
        to see if the source already exists, and allows you to skip or replace an
        existing source record. Warning, this script modifies your database, making a
        backup of your data before running this script is advised.

        within that month.
    <dt><b>bias</b>
    <dd>Version 1.4; by Chandler; output format Text.
        <br>
        Ever notice that certain families seem to have all boys or all girls?
        Sometimes five or six in a row of all the same sex? Is this a mere
        statistical fluctuation, or is something special happening?
        This program gives statistics for male vs female births.
    <dt><b>bkdes16-1</b>
    <dd>Version 1.0; by Wetmore, Manis; output format Text.
        <br>

        Write an (unsorted) list of every person in the database
        whose burial place contains a requested string
        (which is the "town" that this report asks for).
        It matches for the town anywhere in the place field.
        so town can also be a state or county.
        Personally, many of my relatives are from Iowa, so I like to make
        a file of everyone buried in Iowa by entering Iowa to the prompt.
    <dt><b>cid</b>
    <dd>Version 1.0; by Wetmore, Chandler; output format Text.
        <br>

        <br>
        This report will produce a document in Rich Text Format modeled after some
        typewritten and typeset Henry format genealogies I've seen.
        All descendants of a selected person, their spouses and their spouses
        parents, event dates, and NOTEs are included. I generally reserve TEXT
        items for comments I would prefer not to export.
    <dt><b>dates</b>
    <dd>Version 4; by Eggert; output format Text.
        <br>
        Prints out the value of all the lines in your database with the DATE
        tag, along with enough information so you can find the line easily.
        The purpose of this report is so you can sort all the dates in the
        database, so you can look for illegal dates, make birthday lists, etc.
        The dates are printed in the order that they appear in the database,
        Output can then be sorted if this is more useful than the native form.
    <dt><b>db_summary</b>
    <dd>Version 1; by Eggert; output format Text.
        <br>
        This program gives you summary statistics on your database. It
        calculates the number of birth, baptism, marriage, death, and burial
        events, and gives the distribution over centuries of birth/baptisms,
        death/burials, and marriages. It tells you how many different names
        (given names and surnames separately) there are in the database, and
        how many persons have no surname in the database.
    <dt><b>desc-henry</b>
    <dd>Version 8; by Eggert; output format Text.
        <br>
        This program prints out a descendants report, assigning a d'Aboville,

    <dt><b>desc-tree</b>
    <dd>Version 8; by Dick Knowles, knowles@inmet.camb.inmet.com; output format Text.
        <br>
        This report prints a descendant tree for an individual. A
        line is printed for every spouse and child including name,
        database key number, birth, marriage, and death information.
        The user can set the number of generations or they can all be
        done (up to a maximum of 20). The user can also, optionally,
        include step children and family database numbers. There are
        two slightly different output styles, tree and numbered. Here
        are examples of each:
    <dt><b>desc_ged</b>
    <dd>Version 1; by Nicklaus; output format Text.
        <br>
        Generate gedcom of descendents.
        For specified set of individuals for specified # of generations
        down from the top individuals. (e.g. name all your great-grandparents
        for all of your close cousins in one gedcom file)
    <dt><b>desc_html</b>
    <dd>Version 1.4; by Dick Knowles, Scott McGee, anon; output format HTML.
        <br>
        This program is designed to be used in a cgi based genweb site to produce
        a descendant chart for a specified individual. It is based on the desc-tree
        program by Dick Knowles as modified by Scott McGee. A line is printed for
        every spouse and child including name, database key number, birth, marriage,
        and death information.
    <dt><b>descged</b>
    <dd>Version 2000-07; by Tom Wetmore, Cliff Manis, and Chris Eagle; output format Text.
        <br>
        The output of this report is a GEDCOM file of the following:
        all descendents of a named individual
        all spouses of the named indivdual
        spouses of all descendents of the named individual
        (i.e. this program looks only down the tree, never up)
    <dt><b>drep2</b>
    <dd>Version 2.1; by Robert Simms; output format Text.
        <br>
        Produces an indented report on an individual's families and all
        descendant families. Details on individuals include NOTE lines, once.
        Line wrapping is done with indention maintained.
    <dt><b>dump-ances</b>
    <dd>Version 1992-11; by Stephen Woodbridge; output format Text, 80 cols.
        <br>
        Program walks thru one's ancestors and dumps information
        about each family. It prunes the tree so an individual is
        only output once. It is a simple program that is easy to
        make changes to, if you want more or less info printed. I
        have included three date routines get_dates(), get_sdates(),
        and get_ldates for variations in the amount of event info that
        gets output to the file. The program lists all children of the
        families as it walks the tree. The ">>>>" marker on a child
        signifies the line of descent.
    <dt><b>dump_html</b>
    <dd>Version 1.3; by Scott McGee; output format HTML.
        <br>
        dump_html.ll is designed to dump an entire database to static HTML files.
    <dt><b>dump_html_sd</b>
    <dd>Version 1.0; by Scott McGee, Steve Dum; output format HTML.
        <br>
        dump_html_sd.ll dumps an entire database to static HTML files.
    <dt><b>eol</b>
    <dd>Version 4 of 1995-01; by Tom Wetmore and John Chandler; output format Text, 80 cols.
        <br>
        Say you want to know who all of your end-of-line ancestors are, that
        is, your direct ancestors whose parents you have not yet discovered;
        these are the people most of us spend most of our time on researching.
        Here is a program that will produce the list. Any ancestor will be
        listed at most once, even in cases where lines cross. Each person
        is shown with date and place of birth and death -- a "guess" is made
        for the year of birth if it is not known.
    <dt><b>est_life_span</b>
    <dd>Version none; by Rafal Prinke; output format Text.
        <br>
        The program below finds the widest possible span of life, estimating
        the uncertain and some unknown dates on the basis of user defined
        values in the table for various combinations of date modifiers etc.
        Then it compares the midpoints of this with midpoints of others'
        life spans and if they fall within a user defined range, the two
        are considered "possibly identical". This is actually just one procedure
        of several that should be in a program like that - but perhaps the
        most important one as people may change names, occupations, etc.
        but they cannot change the time period. I added two arbitrary tags:
        FAPP and LAPP for "first/last appearance" in sources.
    <dt><b>extract_gedcom</b>
    <dd>Version 1.2 of 1995-08-27; by Scott McGee (smcgee@microware.com); output format GEDCOM.
        <br>
        This program allows the user to select a group of individuals from a database
        and generate a GEDCOM file for them. It allows selection of multiple people
        by following family links, and then allows addition of all ancestors of the
        selected set or of the first individual, and then all descendants of the
        selected set or of the orignal individual. It also allows addition of all
        persons with a specified number of relations to any individual in any of the
        groups added above.
    <dt><b>extract_html</b>
    <dd>Version 1.4; by Scott McGee (smcgee@microware.com); output format HTML.
        <br>
        This program allows the user to select a group of individuals from a database
        and generate a set of HTML files for them. It allows writing multiple people
        per HTML file, and will create an index file and a GENWEB.txt file for genweb
        indexing of the resulting data.

        This program produces a family report of the person (husband), wife,
        their children, and some data about the children's marriages.
        It is presently designed for 16 pitch, HP laserjet III,
        printing a single page of information about that family.
    <dt><b>fam_ged</b>
    <dd>Version 1.1 of 1994-06-08; by Wetmore and Prinke; output format GEDCOM.
        <br>
        This program extracts a gedcom file of all male line descendants
        of a specified person, with their spouses and parents (including
        those of the specified person and of all spouses). Also included
        are possibly illegitimate children of females - when they have
        the same surname as the mother but different than the father (also
        if there is no father recorded).

        (making sure links between kids and spouses go both ways.)
        make sure each family that a person says he is a spouse of
        has him as a spouse, and, vice-versa,
        make sure each person that a family says is a spouse thinks he
        is a spouse of that family
        It also checks when a person says he is a child in a family that
        the family has that person as a child.
        And vice-versa, that every child in a family thinks he
        is a child of that family.

        <br>
        This program computes gender order statistics for children in all the
        families in a database. Genders are considered to be ternary: male
        (M), female (F), or unknown (U). Children in a family form a pattern
        of genders by birth order, e.g. MFFM for a family consisting of a boy,
        two girls, then a boy. The frequency of these patterns is calculated.
        In addition to the complete gender pattern for a family, initial
        gender patterns are computed. For the above example, the initial
        patterns are . (no children), M, MF, MFF, and MFFM. The frequency of
        these initial patterns can be used to answer questions such as how
        many families with a boy then two girls go on to have another boy.

        <br>
        This program produces a report of all descendents of a given person,
        and is presently designed for 12 pitch, HP laserjet III, for printing
        a book about that person. All NOTE and CONT lines are included in the
        report, along with the vital statistics, occupations, immigrations,
        attributes, and wills.
        At the end of the report is a sorted listing of names of everyone
        mentioned, with reference numbers giving the first occurrences of all
        the names.

        <br>
        This program identifies spouses with known common ancestors. For each
        marriage of related spouses, the spouses' names are printed, along
        with the first common ancestor in each branch of the ancestry tree,
        and the number of intervening generations for the husband and wife,
        respectively.
    <dt><b>relation</b>
    <dd>Version 5.0; by Eggert; output format Text.
        <br>
        This program calculates the relationship between individuals in a
        database. It does so in three modes. Mode 1 just does one pair of
        individuals and then exits. Mode 2 does any number of pairs with a
        common "from" person. Mode 3 does all pairs with a common "from"
        person. In general, mode 1 is fastest for simple relationships, but
        if you want one complicated relationship, you may as well do them all.

        A LifeLines report program to aid in the generation of
        Roots Location List (RLL) submissions.
        Given a person, this generates a RLL-like submission for that person and
        his/her ancestors. The output will likely need considerable hand editing,
        but that is how it is. If you need to know what the RLL is, I have enclosed
        a description at the end of this file.

        <br>
        function sealing_line().
        You pass it a person, and it returns the person's
        sealing line (if there is one) or nothing (if there isn't). The main
        program is only used here to test it. You would call "sealing_line" in the
        place you need it in your own program. Yes, it is a little complicated,
        but that's why we have modules. Write it, stick it in some library
        somewhere, and just call it when you need the info.

        This LifeLines report program searches for individuals in the database
        that are missing some birth or death information that may be in the
        social security death index (SSDI). Right now this searches for:
        1. Deaths after 1960 that do not have locations
        2. Births after 1880 with no death event
    <dt><b>ssdi_aid</b>
    <dd>Version 3; by Jim Eggert (eggertj@ll.mit.edu); output format Text.
        <br>
        This LifeLines report program generates a text file that lists
        people who are likely to be in the Social Security Death Index.
        The SSDI starts in 1962 and is periodically updated to include
        more recent years. This program guesses birth and death years
        to make its determinations. If it finds a person likely to be
        in the SSDI, it searches for the string SSDI in their notes to
        indicate that an SSDI entry has already been found. If not, it
        outputs a line about that person.
    <dt><b>st/st_all</b>

    <dt><b>stats</b>
    <dd>Version 10.0; by Jim Eggert; output format Text.
        <br>
        This LifeLines report program computes mean statistics of various
        quantities binned over other quantities. The quantities it knows
        about are ages at and dates of birth, christening, first and last
        marriage, first and last child's birth, death, burial, and today; the
        number of children, siblings, and marriages; and sex, surname, first
        name, soundex, and any simple GEDCOM tag. These can be combined
        nearly arbitrarily and evaluated over the whole database, or
        restricted to ancestors or descendants of a chosen individual or to
        members of a predetermined set. Further restrictions on the
        individuals included in the statistics can be based on any quantity
        that the program knows about. The program will optionally print out
        the names of all the individuals included in the statistics.

    <dt><b>tree_density</b>
    <dd>Version 1; by Jim Eggert (eggertj@atc.ll.mit.edu); output format Text.
        <br>
        This program calculates the weight of each node in an ancestral tree.
        The weight of a node is given by the number of people in the database
        that are most closely related to that node. The degree of relation is
        measured in hops, where a hop is a step to a parent, spouse, sibling,
        or child. Thus this program allows you to get an idea of where most
        of the research has been done, where large numbers of cousins hook in
        to the database, and where more work may be needed.
